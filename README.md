# Anti-Gravity-Ball
A simple 2d game i made in the summer of 2019 and published on Apple Store.
At that time i was just messing around in Unity and C#. With little to none programing experience, i still managed to complete a product from start to finish. Using only YouTube and Stack Overflow. 

Features:
1 Every level is randomly generated, from the number of obstacles to the background design.
2 A progression system. (the more levels you beat the harder it gets, itâ€™s still random just the parameters change to make it harder)
3 Skins(cosmetics) that can be unlocked by progressing further into the game.

Known issues:
1 The game runs only on the Unity version 2019.2.6f1 due to what I think is a bug in the newer versions. The bug consists of: when you are stopping the ball (freeze constrains) and then you release the button the ball is still frozen. And the most interesting part is that sometimes it works as intended but most of the time it doesn't.
